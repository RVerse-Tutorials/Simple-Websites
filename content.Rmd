You can now add as many Rmarkdown files as you want for your content.  Each one will be processed into an html file.  For example in `Test Website`, we have two files, `about.Rmd` and `contact.Rmd`.  Your Rmd files should have the yaml at top and then your Rmarkdown content.

Here is a simple example.

Here is a simple file.
```

`about.Rmd` is a fuller Rmd file with R code and figures.

If you want the file linked to in your top nav bar, then add it to `_site.yml`.   

```
name: "my-website"
output_dir: "."
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  left:
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - text: "Contact"
      icon: fa-user-circle
      href: contact.html
output:
  html_document:
    theme: readable
    toc_depth: 3
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
```
