title: "Required files"
---

There are two required files for a website plus your content (your Rmarkdown files).

The first required file is `_site.yml` which is your configuration file.

The second required file is `index.Rmd` which is your landing page or page #1.

Your content is specified in additional Rmarkdown files.  Not required, but your website is not very interesting without content.
